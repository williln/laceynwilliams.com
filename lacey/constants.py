ABOUT = '''
		Hi! I'm Lacey, a Pythonista and Djangonaut living in Portland, OR. 

		I started coding when I was 26 as part of an apprenticeship program 
		with the University of Texas. For UT, I work in an older mainframe l
		anguage called NATURAL, so I didn't even use Django's model structure 
		until recently! 

		Over the past year, I've become more involved in the open source 
		community. I'm member of the Django Girls Support Team, a developer 
		member of the Django Software Foundation, and I was both the Diversity 
		and Financial Aid chairs for DjangoCon US 2015. I'm also on the 
		technical board for Project Callisto, a non-profit that builds tools to
		help college victims of sexual assault report their experiences to 
		their schools and to law enforcement. 

		My passion is teaching other people how to code, and getting other 
		women involved in programming and in the open source community. If you
		want to help me do that, I want to hear from you!
